This project aims to test the Ghost CMS application by simulating random user actions and analyzing the application's behavior under such conditions. Using Playwright and Ripper testing, we can automate this process and detect potential issues that may arise when using the application. The Playwright tool provides a reliable and fast automation solution for running end-to-end tests, while Ripper testing allows for the creation of randomized and exploratory tests. By combining these tools, we can thoroughly test the Ghost CMS application and ensure its functionality and stability.
